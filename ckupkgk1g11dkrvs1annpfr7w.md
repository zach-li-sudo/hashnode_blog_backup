## Docker Container - A Beginner's Guide 2

### Continued! 

4. Play with Containers

   ##### Exit from a Container without stopping it:

   Using `exit` to escape from a container will turn it down when you get back to the shell of your host machine. To exit without stopping the container, press `ctrl`+`p`, then `ctrl` + `q`, you can exit from the container while it is still running in behind.

   ```shell
   $ docker ps
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
   6f8913b2d51d   ubuntu    "bash"    10 minutes ago   Up 10 minutes             ubt00
   $ docker attach 6f
   root@6f8913b2d51d:/home# ls
   README.md  file.txt  pyTest.py
   root@6f8913b2d51d:/home# read escape sequence
   ```

    Now we check the current running containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker ps
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
   6f8913b2d51d   ubuntu    "bash"    10 minutes ago   Up 10 minutes             ubt00
   ```

   You can see that our container is still running in backstage.

   ##### Check container's logs
   
   We use `docker logs` to check the container's log info.
   
   ```bash
   $ docker logs --help
   
   Usage:  docker logs [OPTIONS] CONTAINER
   
   Fetch the logs of a container
   
   Options:
         --details        Show extra details provided to logs
     -f, --follow         Follow log output
         --since string   Show logs since timestamp (e.g. 2013-01-02T13:23:37Z) or relative (e.g. 42m for 42 minutes)
     -n, --tail string    Number of lines to show from the end of the logs (default "all")
     -t, --timestamps     Show timestamps
         --until string   Show logs before a timestamp (e.g. 2013-01-02T13:23:37Z) or relative (e.g. 42m for 42 minutes)
   ```
   
   To check the output of an Ubuntu container, we first run a container and execute some bash commands in it.
   
   ```bash
   $ docker run -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo container_logs;sleep 1;done"
   c1773d0908d63b0cf3c6569886b7bc38c248d2ff7b64b585705f35672518ab00
   ```
   
   Now the container will output the string "container_logs" every 1 second. Let's access the latest 5 log messages. `--tail` will show from the end of the logs and `-t` allows timestamps on each log message.
   
   ```bash
   $ docker logs -f -t --tail 5 c1
   2021-10-16T08:40:02.220289500Z container_logs
   2021-10-16T08:40:03.222847800Z container_logs
   2021-10-16T08:40:04.229942500Z container_logs
   2021-10-16T08:40:05.237922300Z container_logs
   2021-10-16T08:40:06.246496900Z container_logs
   
   ```
   
   ##### Copy file from container to host machine
   
   Copying files from container to host machine is more or less the same with the [`scp` command](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-scp-command-to-securely-transfer-files/) in Linux shell:
   
   ```bash
   $ docker cp container_id:PATH host_machine_PATH
   ```
   
   To do this, we first access a container and create a file in its root path :
   
   ```bash
   $ docker ps
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED       STATUS       PORTS     NAMES
   0d389aacce6e   ubuntu    "bash"    6 hours ago   Up 6 hours             confident_chebyshev
   $ docker attach 0d
   root@0d389aacce6e:~# touch new_file_in_container.txt
   root@0d389aacce6e:~# ls
   new_file_in_container.txt
   ```
   
   And then, write some in the `.txt` file:
   
   ```bash
   root@0d389aacce6e:~# echo "this file is created in container 0d" > new_file_in_container.txt
   ```
   
   Exit from the container without stopping it: press `ctrl`+`p`, then `ctrl` + `q`. Now we are in the shell of our host machine:
   
   ```bash
   $ docker cp 0d:root/new_file_in_container.txt ~
   $ echo new_file_in_container.txt
   new_file_in_container.txt
   ```
   
   File copying success!
   
   
   
5. Use Docker Volume
   When you want to persist the data generated by Docker containers, Docker Volumes are the preferred choice. These volumes are in your host filesystem (Linux users) or a virtual machine (Docker Desktop for MacOS/Windows users), which confuses many beginners, especially those Docker Desktop users (we talk about this later). Here are some volume commands.

   ```shell
   $ docker volume create my-docker-vol
   my-docker-vol
   $ docker volume ls
   DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
   local     my-docker-vol
   $ docker volume inspect my-docker-vol
   [
       {
           "CreatedAt": "2021-10-17T13:45:08Z",
           "Driver": "local",
           "Labels": {},
           "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/my-docker-vol/_data",
           "Name": "my-docker-vol",
           "Options": {},
           "Scope": "local"
       }
   ]
   ```

   Remove a volume:

   ```bash
   $ docker volume rm my-docker-vol
   my-docker-vol
   ```

   An important implementation of Docker Volumes is to share data between container and host, or share between containers.

   - Share data between container and host:
     Create a container with a new volume:

     ```bash
     $ docker run -idt --name CONTAINER_NAME -v VOLUME_NAME:path_shared_in_container IMAGE_NAME:TAG
     ```

     Here we create a new ubuntu container `ubt-shared` with a new volume `new_volume` and share the path `\tmp` (by default) . 

     ```bash
     $ docker run -idt --name ubt-shared -v new_volume:/tmp ubuntu:latest
     0e9c3e252f231a54e1b243d7894873830143097078de235493353e9b2abe6e09
     ```

      Now we check the running containers and volumes:

     ```bash
     $ docker ps
     CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
     0e9c3e252f23   ubuntu:latest   "bash"    4 minutes ago    Up 4 minutes              ubt-shared
     $ docker volume ls
     DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
     local     new_volume
     ```

     Both the new container and its volume are created. Next we create some files in the shared folder in container:

     ```bash
     $ docker attach 0e
     root@0e9c3e252f23:/# ls
     bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
     root@0e9c3e252f23:/# cd tmp
     root@0e9c3e252f23:/tmp# touch shared.txt
     root@0e9c3e252f23:/tmp# echo 'shared file' > shared.txt
     root@0e9c3e252f23:/tmp# cat shared.txt
     shared file
     ```

     Then we exit from the container and check the shared file on the host machine, by default the path on host is `/var/lib/docker/volumes/VOLUME_NAME/_data`. You will need root password to access this directory:

     ```bash
     $ sudo cd var/lib/docker/volumes/new_volume/_data
     $ ls
     shared.txt
     $ cat shared.txt
     shared file
     ```

     However, for Docker Desktop (Windows/MacOS) users, the path `/var/lib/docker/volumes` does not exist, because the `docker` service are typically doing one of these two things:

     (1) Run Linux containers in a full Linux VM (what Docker typically does today)

     (2) Run Linux containers with Hyper-V isolation.

     So the shared files will not appear in the default path. Please refer to these links for details:
